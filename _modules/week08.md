### Decoding speech from brain activation

We will introduce the concepts of temporal receptive field analysis, zero-shot classification, and other related topics. Additionally, we will explore the characteristics of electrocorticography (ECoG) data and develop a neural decoder to interpret speech from ECoG signals.
