### Neural network methods for brain encoding

We will introduce the concept of ridge regression, permutation tests, t-tests, etc. We will learn how to import raw neuroimaging data and leverage neural network models to craft meaningful representations. Subsequently, we will explore the construction of a sophisticated brain encoding system, integrating fMRI data with computational representations for a comprehensive analysis.
