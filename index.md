Computational Linguistics for Brain Encoding and Decoding
UCAS-AI, Summer 2024
---

This course offers an introductory exploration into the interdisciplinary fields of *natural language processing (NLP)* and the *neurobiology of language (NBL)*. With an emphasis on utilizing NLP as a vehicle for understanding and deciphering the language functions of the brain, it serves as an entry and advanced point for learners. Throughout the course, students will familiarize themselves with fundamental techniques in brain encoding and decoding, alongside an introduction to the background of brain and machine language processing. The course culminates in a collaborative research project among students.

Prerequisites
Students are expected to have seen most of the following concepts before.

PYTHON PROGRAMMING
Basic syntax, Jupyter notebooks, package managers (e.g., pip)

MACHINE LEARNING
Features (discrete vs. continuous), optimization, train/dev/test, classifier/regressor (e.g., Linear regression)

NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
Tokenization, embeddings/representations, language modeling

NEUROBIOLOGY OF LANGUAGE
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalogram (EEG), Magnetoencephalography (MEG) 

As this is an interdisciplinary course at the entry level, encompassing students from diverse backgrounds such as computer science, artificial intelligence, psychology, and linguistics, many may encounter unfamiliar topics. However, it's perfectly acceptable if you find yourself unfamiliar with any of the mentioned subjects. Feel free to look up unfamiliar concepts or ask for assistance whenever necessary.

----------------------------
This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] – the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
