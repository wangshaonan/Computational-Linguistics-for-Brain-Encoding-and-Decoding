# Computational Linguistics for Brain Encoding and Decoding
**UCAS-AI, Summer 2024**<br />

This course offers an introductory exploration into the interdisciplinary fields of *natural language processing (NLP)* and the *neurobiology of language (NBL)*. With an emphasis on utilizing NLP as a vehicle for understanding and deciphering the language functions of the brain, it serves as an entry and advanced point for learners. Throughout the course, students will familiarize themselves with fundamental techniques in brain encoding and decoding, alongside an introduction to the background of brain and machine language processing. The course culminates in a collaborative research project among students.

## Course Staff

## Prerequisites
Students are expected to have seen most of the following concepts before.

{: .note }
> #### PYTHON PROGRAMMING
> Basic syntax, Jupyter notebooks, package managers (e.g., pip)
> 
> #### MACHINE LEARNING
> Features (discrete vs. continuous), optimization, train/dev/test, classifier/regressor (e.g., Linear regression)
